PROLOGUE, OR, THE TRAIN LEAVING THE STATION

There was a reverberating clonk as the back carriage was finally pried loose, and the yelling soldiers were left behind.  Now there were just four carriages of refugees, a dozen railway employees and some militiamen, and a train that wouldn’t stop.
The needle on every meter and gauge was deep in the red, or bouncing around so wildly as to be useless. Elisabeth sighed and wiped her face with a rage, leaving another greasy blotch. She looked around for Chief Engineer Theodophus Grimbold, who, of course, was nowhere to be found. 

She took a chance and left the engine room to push through the first passenger car, filled with grim, cloth-capped civilians sitting in terrified silence. to the roofless carriage they were using to store supplies. She had a brief conversation with Sally, who was cleaning their collection of mismatched muskets, and eventually found Grimbold, hanging off the side of the train by what appeared to be his trusty protractor wedged in the door jamb, grinned wildly.

“The brakes!”

“WHAT?!”

“THE BRAKES!” she screamed over the sound of the screaming train. “THE BRAKES WON’T WORK!”

He shook his head and clambered on top of the train, pulling his flat cap low against the wind, and crawled over to her.
“THE B-”

“You don’t need to shout, I’m right here. And yes, it’s the brakes. I had a look just now – the soldiers must have cut them when we were trying to leave the station.”

She blinked at him. “What does that mean?”

“It means we are royally fucked, Madam Conductor.”

Elisabeth groaned.

CHAPTER 1 - PANIC PLAIN
*Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No it's just a plain. And no we won't be keeping this; I just saw the pun and historical imperative compelled me.

[Design notes: very basic first mission, maybe with some trees or pits that need to be navigated around; otherwise just a flat plain with some time for narrative elements and a chance to introduce basic gameplay]

Description pending

CHAPTER 2 - A RIVER ROARING
*In which our protagonists have to contend with the fearsome powers of unleashed hydronamics!

[Design notes: the bridge over the river has been destroyed by the DAMN GUBMINT and the player has to build a bridge over the river or ford it over a shallow patch]

Description pending

CHAPTER 3 - A PERILOUS ASCENT
*In which the Train must navigate the highs and lows of unforgiving Geography!

[Design notes: a map with ups and downs, possibly either through a canyon system (shorter route has more ascents & descents, longer route is flatter]

Description pending

CHAPTER 4 - BURNING BRIGHT, IN THE FORESTS OF THE NIGHT
*In which the Train must plunge into the not-so-stygian darkness of a forest aflame!
